            Hi there! I'm Aazeem, a 20 year old full-stack web developer who's
            passionate about creating interactive experiences. I'm based in
            Falls Church, VA and Boston, MA. I hold housing in both cities, so
            I'm ready to jump in wherever an opportunity takes me. Currently,
            I'm working as a Front-End Developer at Grid 1 Solutions, where I
            construct and style UI components to build user-friendly
            applications.

            During my internship at Nicky Nice Games, I worked on a team to
            construct a promotional website for a video game start up company.
            At Grid 1 Solutions, I worked on the restoration and modernization
            of a legacy website, revamping its look, improving performance, and
            integrating new content management workflows. I've also been on the
            Dean's List every semester at RIT, where I'm a rising junior
            studying Software Engineering and Game Design & Development. Last
            summer, I completed three AI courses on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng
            to deepen my understanding of machine learning pipelines.

          <p className="mt-1 sm:mt-2 text-white text-sm sm:text-base">
            I thrive in collaborative, Agile teams and love workng with others
            to tackle complex challenges. I believe the best products come from
            combining thoughtful design with clean, maintainable code. Whether
            I'm styling a component or debugging a tricky back-end issue, I give
            100% to deliver polished, reliable solutions.

            When I'm not programming, you'll find me rock climbing, working out,
            playing chess, or grinding levels in fortnite. A fun fact about me
            is that I love to play chess puzzles.
